# MonkeSwim Edtior
Unity editor scripts to add to your [Gorilla Tag Map Project](https://github.com/legoandmars/GorillaTagMapProject)


## Quick overview
Adding MonkeSwim to your map is fairly straight forward, all you need to do is add MonkeSwimManager to a gameobject in the map and attach Gravityzone, PlanetZone, or, OddPlanetZone to your trigger collider gameobjects. If you want to use the swim movement mechanic, add SwimManager to a gameobject and SwimTriggers to your trigger collider gameobjects.

i reccomend adding the mod ID com.AHauntedArmy.MonkeSwim to the map descriptor required mods field
